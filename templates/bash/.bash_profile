# This file gets loaded during interactive logins, like when you SSH into the server.
# It does not get loaded when you do things like deploy via git push.

# The only changes that should be made here are things that modify what your interactive login looks like.
# This would include things like a custom prompt. Other customizations should go in the .bashrc file.

# Include the .bashrc file, which contains all WarpSpeed environment settings.
